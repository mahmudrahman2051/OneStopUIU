# ðŸŽ¯ **PROBLEM FOUND AND FIXED!**

## **ðŸš¨ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
```
ParseError at [row,col]:[95,39]
Message: The entity name must immediately follow the '&' in the entity reference.
```

**Problem**: Line 95 in `section-selector.fxml` had unescaped `&` character in "Safe & Secure"

## **âœ… FIX APPLIED:**

### **XML Entity Escaping**
- **Changed**: `"Safe & Secure"` 
- **To**: `"Safe &amp; Secure"`
- **Reason**: XML requires `&` to be escaped as `&amp;`

### **Navigation Restored**
- Customer accounts now use the original `section-selector.fxml`
- All functionality preserved

## **ðŸŽ¯ WHAT FIXED IT:**

The error was a **simple XML syntax issue** - unescaped ampersand. This is a common issue when using special characters in XML/FXML files. The fix was straightforward but critical.

**Your customer login should now work perfectly!** ðŸŽ‰
